<section id="cheddar-principles"><h1>CHEDDAR principles</h1>

<p><strong>CNAMEs:</strong> Ads, and other third-party
resources such as analytics scripts, served from
what looks to the browser like a subdomain of the
publisher's domain, not from a third-party domain
that appears on multiple publisher sites.  This is
a small change for third parties, but a big barrier
to <q>cookie licking</q> fraud.   And responsible
privacy tools won't block a dedicated subdomain that
can't be used to track users across sites.</p>

<p><strong>HTML5:</strong> avoid the malvertising
risks of <q>vintage</q> plugins by using web standards
only.  Maintaining a reasonably secure device on
today's Internet is hard enough. Users can't maintain
problematic software just to see the ads.</p>

<p><strong>Encryption:</strong> Limit the ability
of ISPs and other observers to gather user data that
can be used for targeting later.</p>

<p><strong>Data leakage protection:</strong>
Many users are still unprotected from
web tracking.   When appropriate, <a
href="http://blog.aloodo.org/misc/howto/">notify
them and offer incentives to get protected</a>.
(This is especially important for brands in
data-sensitive categories such as health care,
and for high-reputation brands that compete with
low-reputation ones in categories such as financial
services and travel.)</p>

<p><strong>DNT:</strong> Respect user norms on
tracking across sites.  
Show that you do this by hosting a copy of the
<a href="https://www.eff.org/dnt-policy">EFF
DNT policy</a> on the ad server.
Respecting DNT is better than
tricking users into giving up information, because <a
href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-07/facebook-said-to-face-decline-in-people-posting-personal-content">eventually,
users figure out what they're uncomfortable with</a>
and take steps to protect themselves.  Meet the users
where they are instead of trying to move norms.</p>

<p><strong>Accountability:</strong> 
In general, <a
href="https://medium.com/@robleathern/deception-funds-your-online-news-86926a2dfbbe#.g5ycatk9w">accurate WHOIS info (Rob
Leathern explains)</a> for third parties, and for
publisher sites too because of the <a
href="https://thetrichordist.com/2013/01/28/over-50-major-brands-supporting-music-piracy-its-big-business/">brand-supported
piracy</a> problem.  Any real solution to
brand-supported piracy depends on cleaning up both
third-party tracking, to protect users from being
tracked to infringing sites, and contact info for
any site where an ad can appear. (If
WHOIS listings are a privacy risk for a site, a web of trust 
can be used instead.)</p>


<p><strong>Reciprocity:</strong> Now you have an ad medium that's
worth something to both ends.  It restores the
essential bargain of advertising: an offer of
<strong>signal</strong> from the advertiser for <strong>attention</strong>
from the audience.  The result is an ad system that's
harder for scammers to defraud, valuable for the
advertisers who pay for it, and rational for users
to accept.</p>
